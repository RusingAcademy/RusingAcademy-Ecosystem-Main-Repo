# Sprint Y1-W2-S10 — Blockers

## Active Blockers

### B-1: Path Series Data Translations
**Status**: Deferred
**Description**: The `pathSeriesData` and `eslPathSeriesData` arrays in CoursesPage contain course names, descriptions, taglines, features, and outcomes that are still in English only. These are product-level content strings (e.g., "Foundations", "Build core language fundamentals") that require professional French translation.
**Action for Steven**: Provide French translations for all 6 FSL paths and 6 ESL paths (name, desc, tagline, focus, forWhom, outcome, features). Alternatively, approve AI-generated translations for review.

### B-2: Value Props and How It Works Steps
**Status**: Deferred
**Description**: The `valueProps` and `howItWorksSteps` arrays contain English-only titles and descriptions. These are smaller sets (4 items each) but still need French translations.
**Action for Steven**: Same as B-1 — provide or approve French translations.

### B-3: Testimonials Translation
**Status**: Deferred
**Description**: The 3 testimonials in CoursesPage are English-only. French testimonials should ideally be separate (not translated) to maintain authenticity.
**Action for Steven**: Provide 3 French-language testimonials from French-speaking learners, or approve translated versions.

## Resolved

No blockers were resolved during this sprint — all items are content-level translation tasks that require Steven's input or approval.
