# Sprint E2 — Content Workflow Board & Lifecycle Management

## Goal
Create a visual Kanban-style Content Workflow Board that gives administrators a bird's-eye view of all content (courses, lessons, paths) across lifecycle stages (draft, review, published, archived), with drag-and-drop status transitions and bulk actions.

## Scope
1. **Frontend**: ContentWorkflowBoard admin page with Kanban columns per status
2. **Backend**: Enhanced content listing endpoint with status counts and filtering
3. **Integration**: Route, sidebar nav, AdminControlCenter section

## Success Metrics
- Admin can see all courses grouped by status in Kanban columns
- Admin can change course status via dropdown or drag
- Admin can bulk-select and transition multiple courses
- Content health summary shows counts per status
- Build passes with zero regressions
