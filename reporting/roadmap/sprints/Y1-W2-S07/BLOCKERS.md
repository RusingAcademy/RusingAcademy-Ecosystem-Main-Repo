# Sprint Y1-W2-S07 — Blockers

## Current Blockers

No blockers requiring Steven's action for this sprint. All changes are self-contained and use existing database schema.

## Future Considerations

| Item | Type | Action Required |
|------|------|-----------------|
| S3 media upload integration | Enhancement | When ready, configure S3 bucket credentials for direct lesson media uploads from the Bulk Importer |
| Video provider API keys | Enhancement | For auto-thumbnail extraction from YouTube/Vimeo/Bunny, provider API keys will be needed |
| Content review workflow notifications | Enhancement | Email notifications for content status changes (draft → review → published) require email service configuration |
| Production deployment | Deployment | Merge PR and deploy to Railway when ready |
