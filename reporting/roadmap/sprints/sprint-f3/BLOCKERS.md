# Sprint F3 — Blockers

## Current Blockers

None. All planned enhancements were implemented without issues.

## Resolved During Sprint

No blockers were encountered during this sprint. The existing page structures were well-organized, making the surgical enhancements straightforward.

## Notes for Future Sprints

The ReadingLab already had a timer implementation from Sprint F1, which served as the reference pattern for the other three labs. The consistent use of `useRef` for interval management ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leaks across all pages.
