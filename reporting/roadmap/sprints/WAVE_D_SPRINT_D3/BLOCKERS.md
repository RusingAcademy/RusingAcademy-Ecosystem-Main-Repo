# Sprint D3 — Blockers

## No Critical Blockers

All 6 pages are functional with professional empty states. No Steven action required for this sprint.

## Future Enhancements (Non-Blocking)

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Wire HRReports to real analytics data | Medium | KPI cards show "—" until backend aggregation endpoints are built |
| Add event creation to HRCalendar | Medium | Calendar renders but has no events yet — needs backend event storage |
| Wire HRNotifications to real notification feed | Medium | Currently shows empty state with preference toggles |
| Add team member invitation flow to HRSettings | Low | "Invite Team Member" button shows toast placeholder |
| SSO/LMS integration configuration | Low | Shows "Coming soon" badges — requires enterprise feature development |
