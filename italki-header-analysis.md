# Italki Header Design Analysis

## Key Observations

### Logo Design
- Logo is a simple rounded rectangle with "italki" text inside
- No separate text next to the logo - the logo IS the brand name
- Logo is approximately 80-100px wide
- Clean, minimal design with good contrast
- Logo has a subtle border/outline effect

### Header Layout
- Logo on the far left
- Navigation links in the center-right area
- Sign up / Log in button on the far right
- Clean white background
- Adequate spacing between elements

### Design Principles to Apply
1. Use full logo image (speech bubble with "Lingueefy" text)
2. Remove separate "Lingueefy" text - logo already contains it
3. Make logo larger (approximately 120-150px width for visibility)
4. Keep header clean and minimal
5. Ensure high resolution for crisp display
