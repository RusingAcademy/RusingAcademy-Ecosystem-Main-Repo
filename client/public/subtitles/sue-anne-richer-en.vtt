00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi there! I'm Sue-Anne Richer,
a bilingual language coach at Lingueefy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I specialize in French and English oral preparation
with immersive conversation techniques.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My passion is helping federal employees
feel confident in both official languages.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I believe that language learning should be
engaging, practical, and fun.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In my sessions, we focus on real workplace scenarios
that you'll encounter in your federal career.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
From briefings to meetings,
I'll help you communicate with confidence.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
My approach combines structured learning
with natural conversation practice.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I've helped hundreds of public servants
achieve their SLE goals.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Whether you're preparing for oral, written, or reading,
I'm here to support your journey.
