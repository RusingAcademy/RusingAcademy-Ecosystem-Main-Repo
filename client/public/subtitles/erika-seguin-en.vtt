Hello! I'm Erika Séguin,
your English performance coach at Lingueefy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I specialize in helping learners overcome exam anxiety
and build confidence for test day.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Many of my students come to me feeling nervous
about their upcoming SLE evaluation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Together, we work on both language skills
and mental preparation strategies.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I believe that confidence is just as important
as vocabulary and grammar.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
My sessions include mock exams,
stress management techniques, and targeted practice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I've helped countless public servants
transform their anxiety into success.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Whether you're aiming for Level B or Level C,
I'll help you perform at your best.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My approach is supportive, patient,
and focused on your individual needs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Book a trial session with me
and let's build your confidence together.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I look forward to being part
of your SLE success story.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
See you at Lingueefy!
Let's turn your goals into achievements.
