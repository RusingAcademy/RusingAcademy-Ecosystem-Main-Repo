Hello! I'm Victor Amisi,
your SLE preparation specialist at Lingueefy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I specialize in BBB and CBC level preparation
with realistic exam simulations.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Having worked extensively with federal employees,
I understand what it takes to succeed.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My approach combines insider knowledge
with practical, hands-on practice.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I create realistic exam scenarios
so you know exactly what to expect on test day.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
From oral interviews to written exercises,
I cover all aspects of the SLE evaluation.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
My sessions focus on building consistency
and confidence in your language skills.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I've helped many public servants
achieve their target SLE levels.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Together, we'll identify your strengths
and work on areas that need improvement.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
