Hello, I'm Steven Barholere,
founder of Lingueefy and RusingAcademy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been helping Canadian federal public servants
prepare for their SLE exams for over 10 years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Whether you're aiming for BBB, CBC, or CCC,
I understand the challenges you face.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My approach focuses on practical conversation skills
and exam-specific strategies.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I've helped over 500 public servants
achieve their bilingual goals.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Together, we'll work on your oral proficiency,
written expression, and reading comprehension.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
My sessions are personalized to your current level
and your specific career objectives.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I offer flexible scheduling to fit
your busy government work schedule.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
