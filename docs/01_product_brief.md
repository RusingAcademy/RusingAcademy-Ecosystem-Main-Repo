## Executive Summary

Lingueefy is Canada's first and only marketplace platform purpose-built for connecting Canadian federal public servants with specialized language coaches for Second Language Evaluation (SLE) preparation. Unlike generic language tutoring platforms, Lingueefy is designed from the ground up around the GC/SLE framework (BBB/CBC/CCC levels), federal workplace contexts, and the unique needs of public servants pursuing bilingual positions.

The platform combines a two-sided marketplace with "Prof Steven AI" — an AI-powered practice partner that provides 24/7 voice-based conversation practice, SLE-calibrated placement testing, and unlimited exam simulations.
