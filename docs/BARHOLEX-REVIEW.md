# Barholex Media Page Review

## Date: January 12, 2026

## Current Content

The page has good structure but needs enhancement per user requirements:

### Existing Sections
1. Hero: "Elevate Your Executive Presence" - Premium audiovisual production
2. Our Services (3 cards):
   - Podcast & Video Production
   - Executive Presence Coaching
   - Strategic Communications
3. Our Process (3 steps): Discovery → Production → Delivery
4. Featured Work (4 illustrative projects)
5. Client Success Stories (2 testimonials)
6. CTA: "Ready to Elevate Your Communications?"

## Missing Sections (Per User Requirements)

The page needs to better express the **consultance mission for schools + EdTech/audiovisual/AI**:

1. **"Who We Serve"** section - schools, training orgs, creators
2. **"Consulting Offers / Packages"** section
3. **"Book a Discovery Call"** CTA (already has "Schedule a Call")
4. Clearer positioning as consultance for external clients (not just RusingÂcademy)
