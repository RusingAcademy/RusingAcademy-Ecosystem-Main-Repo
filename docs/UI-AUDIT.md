   - Images could have subtle zoom effect

3. **Typography**
   - Heading hierarchy could be stronger
   - Line heights need adjustment for readability
   - Font weights could be more varied

4. **Animations**
   - Page lacks entrance animations
   - Scroll-triggered animations missing
   - Micro-interactions on buttons minimal

5. **Visual Effects**

   - Gradients could be more dynamic
   - Background could have subtle patterns/particles
